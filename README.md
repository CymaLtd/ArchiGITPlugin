ArchiGITPlugin
==============

Plugin for Archi that allows models to be versioned to a GIT repository

Installation Instructions
-------------------------
- Download the .jar file from the releases directory (https://github.com/CymaLtd/ArchiGITPlugin/tree/master/releases) and copy it into the plugins directory of your Archi installation (on windows probably C:\Program Files (x86)\Archi\plugins)
- Restart Archi, you should have a new menu items under File/Import and File Export called 'Import Versioned Model' and 'Version Model...' respectively
- For instructions on use, see the wiki - https://github.com/CymaLtd/ArchiGITPlugin/wiki
- Tested with Archi v2.5, use on other versions at your own risk (I think it is unlikely to work with 2.6 based on the documentation)
